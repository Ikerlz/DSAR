# DSAR

## Introduction

- This is the code for the paper "Distributed Estimation of Spatial Autoregression Model for Large Scale Networks"

- There are two parts in the repository, one is for the simulation, which is the matlab codes and the other one is for the real case.

- You can get all datasets and environments from [Baidu Cloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Nughl0MSXKfZB1Z9yOMJ9A?pwd=0000) with passwords 0000.

-----

## How to run the code

### Simulation

You can run the simulation in the Simulation/matlab_code with the file `main.m`.

### Real Case

- In the "Real Case/code", you can run the codes on a spark cluster with `run_spark_yarn.sh`.
- Also, you can run the global algorithm by `global_algorithm.py`.
